# Heart-Attack-Analysis-using-Bayesian-Network
A mini project on Analysis of risk of Heart Attack for people with various health conditions based on the Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction dataset that contains 14 common features namely age, sex, ChestPainType, RestingBP, Cholestrol, FastingBS, RestingECG, MaxHR, ExerciseAngina, oldpeak, ST_Slope, no.ofVes and Thalassemia
The project also impelments brief comparison of the different inferencing approach in Bayesian Network:  
Exact Inference: testing using four different heuristics for variable elimination functions provided by pgmpy library; 
Approximate Inference: using likelihood weighted sampling.
